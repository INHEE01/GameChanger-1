It has a subtle message about what it means to live a good life and to flourish through a combination of hard work and human connection. The Harvest Moon games all basically boil down to managing a mix of time, tasks, and metrics, and recent entries in the series have relied heavily on exploiting a new gameplay gimmick with each iteration: in one it's crafting structures for the town, in another it's trading with foreign economies. The problem with this approach is that once these gimmicks are exhausted — all the houses built or all the goods traded — the games feel hollow. Stardew Valley succeeds by delivering a robust experience that does not merely rely on watching a meter go up. It has something to say and says it well, while never abandoning the core gameplay that attracted players in the first place. \n",

There’s plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley’s secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up.\n",

      "- Sounds and music are very basic and have MIDI quality.\n",
      "- Characters are bland and lack personality.\n",
      "- The gameplay mechanics are boring and repetitive. The combat mechanics is ridiculously uncreative. I felt insulted.\n",
      "The gameplay in general, lack any depth. Everything is a chore, and due poor time management mechanics, it's impossible to not be stressed by this game, And if you want to gift those bland NPCs,  be prepared for more stressful time trying to catch them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And about the story, well, I'm afraid I can't really complete a review because after the first year I stopped playing and deleted this game. Only the thought of going trough all this again was too much for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't think of anything but give this game a solid 0.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "2D farming sim that takes its inspiration from Harvest Moon. But improves on the formula and adds many new mechanics. There is such a huge selection of crops and things to do that you never feel like you have enough daylight. The dungeon combat is very shallow and fishing is a PITA at the start. There is just so much you can do but not a lot that you have to do. The missions are generic. Better missions would make this game a lot better.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This game has so much love and wisdom. The critics of a modern life are so true. The atmosphere is all about the beauty of a landlife in a village with being committed to other villagers and nature instead of a unnatural live in a city as an employer for a corporation.\n",
      "So, yes this game is about more than just farming simulation. In addition you can fish, explore dungeons, build up your farm, help to build up the village, making friends and even marry. Later on you start to think, what you will do in the day, because there is so much to do and the day time is restricted. Anyway, after few weeks the game becomes repetitive and you feel the need to grind. Another weakness is the bad overview of all the items. There are so many and you need to search, where you need an item you have found. It is not only that you need to look ingame, but also in wiki, to know what to do with it -> Fun killer. This all should be ingame and easier to manage.\n",
      "Graphics looks really too old and simple. The good thing is, it is looking sweet and fits to the whole atmosphere of the game: not modern graphic. Anyway it could be better.\n",

      "Great game with great idea's but something is missing.\n",
      "there is no endgame and not really much content ( in Winter you cant do really much).\n",
      "But the first 20 hours of game play you are having a lot of fun and that makes it a great game.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A fun and extremely charming game that’s great when you just want to relax and have a good time. It takes the concept of harvest moon and not only makes everything better but it also incorporates new ideas and gameplay mechanics in a brilliant way. Everything from the farming to the combat to the character interactions are great considering the type of game it’s trying to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the game is not without its flaws. After playing it for a while things start to get repetitive and things like farming feels more like real lives chores instead of fun gameplay. The game also loses the sense of meaningful progression after a while and after that it loses traction in trying to push me forward in the game. Though these flaws are only based on my personal opinion and these feelings might not apply to everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it’s just what I wanted from this kind of game and I loved playing it. Though it is not one of the most memorable games that I’ve played, it’s defiantly one of the most charming. If the game had clearer and bigger goals to accomplish it would have hooked me for a lot longer but the magic of the game wore of quicker than I would have hoped. But in the end it’s a good game and I would recommend it to everyone that want to play a charming and relaxing game.\n",

It's completely up to you.  I have over 300 hours of gameplay and still haven't finished the game because I took my time.\n",
      "Not many games have kept me entertained for over 300 hours of gameplay, but this is definitely an exception to the rule.\n",
      "The story is amazing, the art style is soothing and the gameplay is excellent.\n",

      "Truly an amazing game, it has so much content in its insane, it has dungeons with slimes, bats, prehistoric monsters, golems, ghost, mummies, etc. You can farm allot of stuff, not just crops, you can farm trees, bees, farm animals like sheep, cows, ducks, chickens, you can also have horses, dogs and cats. There's also foraging and fishing (Honestly not a big fan of how fishing works on this game since it has slippery controls that the fish ai ens up abusing it once you find a good catch.) theres several replayable events and a game filled with quest. Honestly this game deserves the high rating it has since it has amazing soundtrack, characters that stand out with allot of dialogues and they also have different interactions depending on how close you are to them with the heart system. The game is allot of grinding but in my opinion it's one of those few games where I actually enjoyed putting hours into, when i first bought Stardew I literally played for 11 hours in a single day which is unusual for me. The game is super well made with very little bugs, which the bugs where mostly in the valley fair's mini games event.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amazing art style. The game felt extremely relaxing. It was very stress-relieving and enjoyable. I loved interacting with the characters, grinding, and crafting new material. It did not become boring with time - games similar to this usually tend to do that to me.\n",

      "This is an excercise in reuse of coding, with RNG as the main gameplay mechanic to fill in some (very limited) sense of unexpectedness.  Most of the artifical game mechanics are hidden, forcing you to be yet another wiki-warrior, wading through countless pages of information that shows how little logic or balancing is in Stardew Valley.  When you realize the lone developer designed this to allow you to easily maximize profits if you already know what you are doing, most of the crops can be skipped as they are only useful for in-game achievements which have not actual gameplay value except as the freemium gold star which is what this should be most famous for.  Basically, Stardew Valley is a freemium-like game that pats you on the head repeatedly for doing very little, which seems to be exactly what many people apprectiate (or do not realize what is happening to them).\n",
      "\n",
      "When examined as a whole it does not really qualify as a game since there is no way to win, or to lose.  Once you realize that, you can skip days at a time which quickly robs this of any meaning at all.  If you have endless hours (50+) and OCD, then this piece of software is for you.  If you actually want a game, a sim, or some combination thereof, look somewhere else (as of Jan. 2018).\n",

      "Once you arrive at the property you find it in a unkempt state, strange that place grandpa love so much was so run downed. And you begin rebuilding it by doing various tasks and jobs, while getting to know the towns people.\n",

      "The in game time moves so fast, that you'll always feel like you need to rush everything in order to get things done in time.\n",
      "To find out what you need to do, you need to go the bulletin board in town, which wastes time getting to and information like characters birthdays are not saved in your journal.\n",

      "Doing precise things can be a problem as you interact with items, which either relies on what direction you are facing or where the cursor is. Miss clicks can happen when you use items causing you to waste resources. The game always asks to confirm you eat something.\n",

      "The Fishing mini game is just poorly made and is not fun to play. Mining is can be annoying, as enemies will continue to respawn. A notable bug is, when multiple exit ladders can spawn in a single level but go to the same place. The torches are awkward to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The art of the game ranges from ok to bad. This game has no focus, it tries to be a relaxing game with its tone and dialog, but its pacing and mechanics make you rush through stuff to avoid wasting resource and chances to progress.\n",

Now, I can see how others would enjoy this game, but I for sure do not have enough patience to fully enjoy it. It's slow paced but not necessarily in a bad way, just too slow for my personal licking. It's unique, and I liked the feel of owning a farm. One thing that I think is just bad is how repetitive it can get can be really irritating. But i recommend the game anyway, it's not terrible, for some it's a great game! I just didn't enjoy the slow pace, but for sure it's not a really bad game.\n",

      "\n",
      "The biggest problem with this game is, there has been many, many games, like this before it, that has done a significantly better job at what Stardew Valley is trying to achive. It's a farming simulator, but anyone aware of Harvest Moon can tell you it does a better job. It's a dungeon crawler, but only in the lightest of senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even then, Rune Factory not only did it better, but offered a huge selection of spells, skills, abilities, weapons, varying dungeons and even bosses. It's a crafting game, but the fact is, it offers much less then more traditional crafting games such as MineCraft or Terraria.\n",
      "\n",
      "It suffers from classic issues such as vague quests, plots and more. It can be a massive grind at times and can end up being incredibly tedious, to the point some people may become frustrated. And while multiplayer was initially announced, it's been pushed back for a later date (if we ever see it). Is it just me or is that completely disappointing? The one thing it could have done to really set itself apart from it's predecessors and it doesn't do it. And now that the game has been fully released, how can we expect to see that feature? 'Don't Starve' had to do a completely separate release to account for multiplayer aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "What it boils down is, Stardew Valley isn't a bad game. I enjoyed the time I spent so far with the game, but, it doesn't really do anything new or innovative for a genre that has been around since the 90's. Stardew Valley is really very mediocre. Hopefully, in time, with a few updates pushed out, they'll prove me wrong.\n",

      "It's just dripping, oozing and overflowing with it. This is a game with so much character and truly dedicated attention to detail, I wish I could give it a hug, and tell it how special it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's an ode to that marvelous old farming game which sings with a delightful glee that reminds you so much of why you pine for the founding era of game design.\n",

      "A one-man developer has produced what feels like it could have been done with an army of artists and designers. Bravo, ConcernedApe.\n",

      "Awesome pixel harvester and after work-\"escaper\". Build your farm, explore caves, level your skills and craft your equipment. Luv it from the beginning and will spend many hours creating my own pixel fake life!\n",

      "Charming, Nostalgic and good soundtrack too.\n",

      "Fans of Harvest moon/animal crossing should feel right at home with this title, Newcomers will also love to experience a decent HM similar on PC\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is my favourite game in the last 10 years. So far the Dev released 6 patches (in 3 weeks) and the game itself is marvellous and reminiscent of old times when games were created to be fun, not to make the most amount of money. A very nostalgic experience with all the touches of life-improvement modern features. Amazing.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "All I can say is WOW! The level of detail put into this game is mind blowing.  It already has me and my husband addicted and I'm incredibly impressed at how much fun this game is!  I Am a huge Harvest Moon fan and the two are definitely similar.  However, you can tell that there was so much more heart and soul put into this game than that of Harvest Moon.  For those of you that don't like the fishing...I felt that way at first but I gradually got the hang of it and found it to be quite fun.  Awesome job ConcernedApe.  This is quite an accomplishment!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I never played Harvest Moon so I do not have much basis for comparison.  Yet, what I can say is that this game seems masterfully made and is addicting as all hell.  It took me a couple of in-game days to get into it and understand it, but everything was simple and self-explanatory enough that I was able to jump right in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really an inspiration to learn that it was just one guy that made this game and what a job he did.  The art is great, the music is great and all of the characters have such specific backstories and behaviors that you'd think a whole team made it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed a couple of glitches, but nothing game breaking.  My biggest issue with the game though is in the lack of settings and options.  I would like to be able to play at work, but I cannot make the screen small enough to do so.  Additionally, volume control is limited to music on or off.  I also would like to be able to save other than at the end of a day, but I can see where that's ultimately problematic from a design perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "ConcernedApe, you da real MVP.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I absolutely love this game.  I became interested in the game when I heard about it on all of the usual video game websites.  I've never played a game like this before, but my girlfriend loved Harvest Moon back in the day and we are both are in love with this game.  It is one of the first games we've ever played where we can both play.  Are growing farm has 1 of each animal, all given nicknames very personal.  A goat that has a combination of my in-laws names for his own.  A pig named Porkins in honor of the Star Wars character, because why not!?!?\n",
      "\n",
      "Being able to give personal names to these animals, your child, your farm, etc. Make the property and assets you own in the game feel like your own, you're more invested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay loop is satisfyingly addictive, and there's a lot of flexibility in how you can play the game.  My first play through was mostly focused on a moderate amount of farming, lots and lots of foraging, mining, and fishing to make a little extra income so I could gradually level up my tools.  My second play through was noticeably different. Focusing heavily on crops and saving up to buy next season's crops in bulk, I was usually so tired after watering all of the crops, I usually didn't have enough energy to fish, mine, or cut down trees.  My time was then spent putting more focus into befriending people (because it doesn't use energy, the game's version of stamina.) and I have the excess crops to afford that kind of generosity.  It pays off though.  The recipes and perks of being good friends with your neighbors allows you to learn new recipes for food that can restore that crucial energy meter, or they can send you the odd gift like useful supplies for the farm.  Those are two different play-throughs with two very different consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want to do nothing while your farm makes it's own money?  Craft 3 dozen bee boxes and let them generate $100 (or even more if you place them near flowers) per bee box every 4 hours.  Want to be the country's largest producer of pumpkins?  Use every square inch of your farm to plant 2600 pumpkins... Have fun watering them every day.  Or you can become a spelunker and dig down into the mines and try and collect as many minerals and resources as you can get.  There are many ways to make money in this game.  That freedom is yours to decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controls are a mixed bag with a gamepad, I've had a few head slapping moments where seeds, walls, floors, fertilizer were placed somewhere they shouldn't have been. Does it affect the gameplay much?  No, it doesn't.  But when it does happen, 1 or twice every few hours of gameplay, it reminds me that a keyboard and mouse is the best way to play this game.  But if you're a gamepad gamer like myself, don't be dissuaded to ignore this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game mostly functions well, I have come across a few glitches in the game, but most of those have been resolved by a dedicated 1-man developer who's interacted with the booming fanbase of a game that he passionately made on his own within 4.  He's constantly releasing patches, there have even been occasions where he has personally helped repair save files of people who have lost progress on their game.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very personal game that should not be overlooked.  Play the game the way you want, get sucked into the gameplay loop of \"One more day\"  while your eyes are red and you're staring at the computer screen at midnight when you have work tomorrow.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is an excellent game overall. There are not many issues with it, other than there is no endgame. I enjoyed this game a lot, but it could use some improvement. That being said, the amount of content in this game, despite it only having one person working on it is impressive.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For real, this is the very best \"Harvest Moon Style\" game I've ever played.  The balancing act of planning the size of a farm you can reasonably water each day while trying to build up the resources to get better sprinklers is amazingly fun.  The characters are absolutely charming and realistically written.  The entire game is an exercise in chipping away at the jade and ice that forms around your heart as you age.  I cannot believe this game was made by one person.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have definitely played enough to tell this is a beautifully crafted, fun, addictive game that checks all kinds of boxes for nostalgia, entertainment, and one more turn (or day). It has a lot in common with Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon, and borrows small amounts from Terraria, Minecraft, and Don't Starve, but perfects the formula by taking exactly what it needs from those franchises and focuses on the farming, gathering, crafting, and relationship sim.\n",
      "\n",
      "This game will have INCREDIBLY long legs and be played by many people for many years. It has a vibrant community and a lot of depth and challenge for people wanting to do everything. Me, my wife, and my daughter all love this game!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Picked this up after seeing several friends playing it, and the only 'complaint' I could come up with would be \"Now I want to buy a farm in a bad way.\" Game is seriously just a ton of fun... well worth what it's selling for.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "AMAZING GAME! Almost perfect and with the future patches i have no doubt this will become a 10/10.\n",
      "If you are a fan of the ol Harvest Moon...Get this game asap!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What a fantastic game. A true Harvest Moon (Story of Season) experience has finally come to the PC. The artwork is fantastic and music is great. I love how it is not about item hoading to make stuff, though there is crafting, it is not to the point of where the harvest Moon (Story of Seasons) games have gone and stuff feels fresh again. it is an overall joy with tons to do, lots of crops and animals to raise, and an adventure.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been wanting this game for ages!  A Harvest Moon on PC, with loads of content!  Bonus, it takes really awesome aspects from different harvest moon style games and incorporates them into a single awesome game!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can dungeon crawl, I can woo townsfolk, I can grow crops, take care of animals, and much more!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so used to these being Japanese games, but this game definitely feels more western, it is hard to pin down exactly why. It is kind of refreshing!\n",
      "\n",
      "The game looks fantastic, sounds fantastic!  The controls aren't perfect for a controller, but they work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also gay friendly!  I, as a lady, can woo the ladies!  So good!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm going to be frank here; I don't see where all the hype is for this game. I played and loved Harvest Moon on the GBA and NGC, and thoroughly played Animal Crossing, Minecraft and Terraria. Unfortunately, this game failed to meet the expectations I had after hearing all the hype that it was supposedly an amazing spiritual successor to Harvest Moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game is really slow and nothing much happens for long periods of time besides repetitive farming, and not out of volition but out of necessity in order to make the game gradually less grindy. The game doesn't really introduce anything new to the casual farming simulator formula, and I don't see how it is as good as people claim it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "How should I say it? It's like the game doesn't feel satisfying to play. It's as if I'm just pushing on in order to see what happens further on in the game, which isn't much. The only part that's kind of fun to play is the mining because of the battling and exploration, but if that's all I'm playing the game for, I might as well play Terraria instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried multiplayer as well as installing some mods, which significantly improved my gameplay experience, but I'm still struggling to justify playing the game further. If you want my advice, stick to Harvest Moon or Terraria. You'll enjoy (re)playing those instead of this.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "First time on PC: I would just try it out a bit, I thought...\n",
      "Six hours later I had my first chickens...\n",
      "\n",
      "And even if played through the game on pc I bought it on my switch and did everything all over.\n",
      "Lovely colorful atmosphere with feel good vibes.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stardew Valley is not only a farm game were the player needs to take care of watering the crops, feeding animals and so forth, it gives you so much more! From befriending nearby villagers, dungeon crawling and house decorating, this game gives it all!\n",
      "\n",
      "One more thing I noticed is the price tag. It's so low for the amount of time you can spent in this game, it's absurd. It sold better then CoD on steam in 2016 which is not only funny, but also highly admirable!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Looking for stress-free game? Stardew Valley very suits you.\n",
      "Its very nice game to play like your own life if you dont have one.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Игра в своем жанре очень хороша в своем жанре.\n",
      "Но она не для всех.\n",
      "Кому то зайдет а кому то нет.\n",
      "Мне просто не зашла.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Harvest Moon is back! And its simple and fun again. From the soundtrack to its gameplay its simply a true work of art done by one man. Thank You STARDEW VALLEY.o0O\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A very relaxing and enjoyable game to play; especially with others. I found little to no bugs nor glitches. Surprisingly, repetition wasn't a problem at all. There were no problems farming the same crop or even catching the same fish because there are a large variety of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are great. Every one of them are unique, and may open up to you overtime depending on how you interact with them. Though, your relationships can and will decay if you don't talk to a person for a day. This won't affect you too much unless you neglect someone for too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is one of the best parts in my opinion. I feel like the story isn't really about rebuilding the community center, rather your adventure; every character's story can be different. I don't know how to exactly explain it, but just know you have freedom over what you want to do and what order you do it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end-game is when your farm is fully complete: Everything is automatically maintained, you have many buildings that serve different purposes, your farm is refined and polished, etc. Though I must add, the end-game is a bit lacking like many people say.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I most love about this game is the information it feeds you - I didn't need a wiki for anything. You're given useful tips and information from villagers, signs, letters, TVs, and even books.\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely recommend Stardew Valley - except if you like to finish games quickly. I feel like the way to truly enjoy this game is by basking in it, like how people take their time eating to fully enjoy the food's flavour.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great game in my opinion, and a great way to relieve stress too. Sometimes you gotta escape from reality, and Stardew the Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something funny to add, I bought this game three times (Switch, PS4, Steam) because I love it very much.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutly amazing game! If you want to enjoy it the most then dont watch any tutorials\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is an amazing Harvest-Moonesque/Animal Crossingesque inspired game. I've been following the development for a while and I was still really impressed with the quality of this game. Combine that with the fact that one guy made this and there's no reason not to get it if you've been looking for this type of game for the PC.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The best game of 2016 thus far for me. Rarely does an indie game pack so much polish and content into a finished product and nail the mechanics so hard that it's almost impossible to put down.\n",
      "\n",
      "As others have said, if you're an existing Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing fan, you've found your new home with this game on the PC - but if you're a fan of well made RPG/management sims in general, you're going to absolutely adore this as well.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a great game made by a developer that has mashed all of our favorite games into one.  It is like so many games, but like no other.  Games like Harvest Moon never held my attention too long, but this has so many things to do that it keeps me hooked for hours.  I can't suggest this any higher to anyone that liked Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or just any relaxing game to play.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dont usually write reviews and even less review games on steam, but this is totally an exception. As i progress further into the game i'll update, but i got pretty much information to give on you guys for now.\n",
      "Im a big Harvest moon fan, actually not that much, in fact the only ones i played was Friends of Mineral Town and Back to Nature, and ow boy, Back to Nature... i've spent easily 500+ hours on that game, it is just so good to start something with barely nothing and turn it into a big thing (That's why i love games like Tropico 5,XCOM, Total War ETC).\n",
      "I know its boring but i'll need to make a lot of comparisons with Harvest moon Back to Nature (because it was the only one i REALLY played and enjoyed)\n",
      "First off by the story, you are the grandson of a farmer which lives in a small town called Stardew valley, its not explained if you lived with him or not (probably not), one day, he leaves you a letter, and asks you to open it when you grow tired of the City life.\n",
      "Twenty years have passed and you are working for a company called Joja which is somewhat a parody or critic of the today's companies, \"enslaving\" his workers. One day at work, you grow tired of being exploited and decides to open the letter, only to find out you grandfather has left his farm all to you, to start a new life.\n",
      "Well its pretty much back to nature, but there you live in the city and visit your grandfather in vacations, people already knew you basically but from what i remember he stopped visiting and got somewhat forggoten. his grandpa dies and he gets the farm. So my point is, this is not a ripoff, i was so glad to see such familiar storyline, but from now on things really change so don't be mad.\n",
      "So you are introduced to your new, devasted, overgrown land, 500 moneys and 15 seeds as a gift from the mayor, so with hard work you need to transform a terrible once forgotten farm, 500 bucks and 15 seeds into a money-maker machine, restore the town's economy and bring the people together again. (i'll explain)\n",
      "So, Joja gets in the city, everything is different, people likes TV more than hanging out, the once high populated city hall is destroyed and the economy is really bad, so it's up to you to maybe kick joja out (i don't know yet if this is a possibility)\n",
      "So let's go to some things you can do and have:\n",
      "-You have some basic tools, which is used to: chop trees down,mine ores and rocks,watering crops,prepare the soil, fishing and foraging.\n",
      "-There's plenty of ways to make money in the game, including your primary crop plantation in your farm (beside animals like chickens giving you eggs), Mining, Fishing and even fighting and looting monsters!!!!\n",
      "-Socialize with other people and even marry and (maybe) have children\n",
      "-Participate in festivals held by the locals\n",
      "-Have a pet like a cat or a dog\n",
      "So now i'll list somethings different than BtN.\n",
      "-There are monters, yes! you can actually fight them and loot them, they are pretty though tho, but you can upgrade yours weapons and equipment in the guild hall.\n",
      "-Bigger Map\n",
      "-Bigger and more beatiful farm land\n",
      "-You can craft and build items like chests, scarecrows, sprinklers, furnacers etc\n",
      "(Im missing things for sure so don't hesitate to comment and correct me)\n",
      "Overall its pretty much the same mechanics about farming and etc and i completely love it!\n",
      "Although there is somethings i didn't liked\n",
      "-Females are not cute like the Harvest moon ones (I really preferer those japanese stylish art for women)\n",
      "-The guys are really cool and the girls not so much, there is one that has a band and rides a skate sometimes!\n",
      "-The energy system really needs an overhaul, its frustating in the start but becomes too much underpowered on the early to mid game!!\n",
      "-The TV could use some more work\n",
      "The soundtrack is simply amazing, it really gives you this \"farm\" feel!\n",
      "This is a great game, and it was made by one guy only (which has worked on StarBound) buy it now if you love Harvest moon like me or if you like micro management games like Tropico 5,Sim City etc, its really worth its price, i've been playing this for 5 hours straight, no recent games has done this to me, so this is a GREAT sign!\n",
      "Really, JUST BUY IT!!!!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In recent years, the Harvest Moon series has died down some over the course of several new games, where the next one does not really add anything new to the last. Until now, the only alternative to the series has mostly been Rune Factory, which is also a very good series. This game, however takes the good from both series and breathes new life into the formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has many elements that any player of either series would be more than familiar with: farming crops, raising livestock, fishing, and mining. And everything is timed with the daily clock and monthly calendar dates, with special events happening every so often. These categories work the same way as their inspirations for the most part, however there are some key differences. A big over-arching change is that your farmland is almost completely customizable. Other than your house, there is nothing that is pre-placed, and your land area is gigantic. This allows for a fully customized farm that is unique to you. Fishing has a minigame instead of automatically catching whatever you hook; at first, the minigame is extremely difficult, but it does not take long to get used to. Farming also comes with conveniences that never existed before, such as upgradable sprinklers that water tiles of your crops for you (the amount depends on the level of sprinkler) as well as several kinds of fertilizers that have different effects on your crop. Raising animals is mostly the same, however the range of animals that you can care for is vast, including chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, and cows. All of these areas of the game work well, and as one would expect, with there being plenty of variety in all three. Any of these elements can be completely ignored if desired and the player can still make a profit. There is no rush to get to anything at a certain time (for the most part) and the game can be played at your own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mining can be best described as a combination of Rune Factory's combat and Harvest Moon's cave systems. Each floor has a ladder that needs to be found to move on to the next floor, with there being better ore, minerals, gems, etc to mine the deeper you go. Inside the mine are various monsters that can be killed, sometimes even required to kill. The combat is simple, where LMB swings your melee weapon, holding LMB charges up a slingshot, and RMB does various special actions depending on the weapon. However, the simplicity works for the game, as you are always on the clock, and if it were too complex there'd be too much time spent fighting. There is something special at the very bottom of the mine, giving even more reason to explore it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, a Harvest Moon inspired game would not be complete without interactions with the townsfolk. The system is the same as it is in Harvest Moon, where you can talk with villagers and give them gifts to get them to like you more. Unlike Harvest Moon, you can only give two gifts per week, meaning the progression of affection is a lot slower unless you complete quests or special interactions with each villager. So long as you give the right gifts and complete the special tasks, it still will not take too long before your chosen bachelor or bachelorette can be married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite everything the game does right, there are some issues with it. The running speed is atrociously slow, especially with diagonal movement. You do eventually unlock a horse, but the horse only speeds up diagonal movement; the vertical and horizontal run speeds remain the same. In addition, the bachelors and bachelorettes vary from each other with personality, however they are fairly two dimensional with their personalities. The developer also apparently had a stroke at one point because if you look at the progression of their appearances, there is a point where they gradually become worse and more same-faced, losing some uniqueness to them. There is also a very unfitting anti-corporation message in the game that could have been left out. The overall graphics style is up to personal preference, but I personally like it and think it does a good job creating the comfy atmosphere these games are known for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the game is capable of being fully modified due to how simple the engine is made. Every pixel can be changed, and mod tools are in the process of being created to add extra content. There is already a mod that changes the appearances of the bachelorettes to an earlier time, as a result of many individuals wanting them altered. So who knows what the developer and modders will add to the game in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this game has just as much if not more content than any of the more modern Harvest Moon games yet is half the price. There are some aspects that I did not even mention such as the sewer dungeon and what is basically the Harvest Sprite tasks because I am 18 hours in and still haven't finished either of those things, nor have I seen everything the game has to offer yet. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Civ5-level addiction. Simple gameplay with a refreshing amount of content. I was amazed at the amount of things I could do. If you want a casual game just to kick back and relax, this game is for you.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you love Harvest Moon and/or Rune Factory this game is for you. Hours of content, great ost and I'm yet to encounter a single bug. What's more amazing is that the game was created by a single person and it isn't an early access game either, it's 100% done product and the developer has stated that there will probably be more content in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the price is just $15 or 13.99 euros.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Charming and addictive in the purest possible way. The no scope MLG kiddies might not care much for the graphics and assume the game sucks because of that, but that just means they are missing out. This game is the best $15 you could possibly spend since Rocket League's debut.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Surprisingly good game!  I was not sure i would like it when i first saw it because it looked like another farming game.  It has surprising depth and there are many ways to make money.  The game does a great job of giving you nudges on what to do but leaves the strategies up to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved it!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stardew Valley is another farming simulator that is reminiscent of the old 2D Harvest Moon games. What it does better than the Harvest Moon games is that it does not gate its content behind time limits. From the very beginning, you're able to complete any of the objectives presented to you in game provided that it is the right season. After playing the frustration that was the latest Story of Seasons that required you to sit through 4 years of game time to unlock everything, this was a nice refreshing change. The story is fairly plain and there's not much that develops it, but it doesn't matter in the long run. My only complaint is the rather small inventory size, especially when a single item has at least three item qualities meaning that it can take up three item slots.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amazing game, way better than Harvest Moon. It has great content and gameplay. The grind isnt too bad, the game has lots of items and events to keep your character busy throughout the seasons. 10/10. Natsume should hire this guy!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My Girlfriend loves it. I haven't played it but i guess 98% positive Reviews on Steam speaks for itself. Would give it a 10 but it has no other Languages than English atm. These kind of Games need more Translations.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stardew valley is (soon to be) multiplayer Harvest Moon on the PC with mods and stuff. If that doesn't draw you in...\n",
      "\n",
      "Stardew Valley is a farm/country life simulation. But don't think Farming Sim 20XX. Stardew Valley focuses more on the people than the crops, creating a laid back atmosphere for you to enjoy as you explore the surrounding area, adventure in the depths of the mine, or try to choose from among the different dating opportunities in town.\n",

      "I was pleasantly surprised by this game, having never played something even remotely similar I was a little skeptical when I bought it, but I am so glad I did. The graphics are lovely and charming and really sets the tone for the game, and the game play while relatively simple has yet to become boring and lack luster. But what really made me love this game was how quickly I came attached to the characters, the town, etc. Starting off as the new guy in town and slowly integrating yourself into the community has been something that I have found so rewarding. If you are even remotely interested in this game, please give it a try, an easy 10 and one of the most engaging and addictive games I have every played.\n",

      "Ele é um jogo que poderiam ser bom mas cheio de ideias mal executadas. Ele tenta ser megalomaníaco demais, e importa elementos de minecraft de uma forma que fica bem irritante. Pra zerar o jogo você tem que reerguer um centro comunitário que fica no quinto dos infernos do segundo mapa e tem que ir lá pessoalmente quando consegue um novo item necessário. Deveria dar pra administrar à distância mas não... Achou o peixe que vc quer? Vá pessoalmente no centro comunitário e vá num menu complicado inserir o peixe pessoalmente... É extremamente idiota.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ele comete o pecado de apresentar a robin que é a mulher com os sprites mais bonitos do jogo, e colocar ela como casada. Isso é um absurdo. Tudo nesse jogo é esquerdista. A maioria dos personagens em vez de serem caricaturados e agradáveis como num harvest moon/rune factory são todos cheios de defeitos e detestáveis. Eu poderia ficar listando mas eu não quero ser banido do metacritic. Os sprites são feios, as garotas são feias, a trilha sonora é chata, a movimentação é truncada, ele não anda na diagonal, o som dos passos é irritante, o jogo te limita a dar só 2 presentes por personagem o que limita seu progresso com ele, o design do mapa é confuso, ele não te mostra aonde está todo mundo. Deveria ser um jogo que abraça mais a fantasia, já que não é um mundo real que está lá(tem magia!!!). Deveria ter opções de teleporte como um teleporte pra praia ou pras minas, ou pra casa do feiticeiro, ou pro spa. Deveria ter menos items no jogo, é item pra caralho, e não tem como saber qual personagem gosta de qual item. Ele é um jogo incoerente, a maioria dos personagens não parece ser influenciada ou mesmo saber das minas mágicas com monstros, isso não afeta a vida deles, mesmo sendo uma cidade pequena...\n",

      "\n",
      "Se você é perfeccionista, NÃO jogue esse jogo, a lista de tarefas nele é algo de dar ansiedade ao extremo. A angustia de não saber aonde está um personagem que você quer presentear, esse sistema de poder perder a amizade com alguém com o tempo por não falar com a pessoa... é um jogo nao precisava trazer tanto a vida real a ele.\n",
      "Ele é um jogo feito pennsando em um grinding pesado, em uma repetição totalmente insana. Vc é recompensado com pequenas migalhas de progresso que não satisfatórias, pois como eu já disse, os personagens são estranhos, e são demais como pessoas na vida real.\n",
      "\n",

      "It's a game with a lot of diversity, from growing crops and raising livestock, to fishing, to exploring the mines, to developing relationships with the townsfolk, to customization of your farm, to completing quests, etc.  It mixes Harvest Moon and Minecraft, and it's a marriage made in heaven!\n",

      "There is one negative I can see in the game: the social aspect.  It lacks depth.  I think VG developers have improved in this area a lot in the last decade, so I may be spoiled in that regard.  I just felt it was lacking in Stardew Valley.  Villagers don't have a whole lot to say, and unique events are limited.  I would have loved to see this part fleshed out a lot more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, it's an amazing game.  And for the price, you can't go wrong!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I played animal corssing growing up, and this adds so much more to it but keeps a bit of nostalgia. It's inovative because there is so much to discover and so much to do with the addictivness level of the \"one more turn\" idea from Civ 5.  The music is great and the graphics while basic, get the job done. It's easy to mod, and as soon as they add multiplayer it should be even more fun.  The reason I'm taking points off is at some times it can feel a tiny bit grindy, but other than that I highly recommend it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This game has a depth to it that I was not expecting when I first purchased it as a time-killer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stardew Valley is a fantastic game that successfully brings back the nostalgia of the SNES-era Harvest Moon title while infusing it with new concepts and depth to bring it into the current era of gaming.  The game is simple enough to learn and play and makes an excellent game for couples to play alongside each other as the game was easily picked up and played by my non-gamer girlfriend with minimal problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The player starts as a farmer with basic tools and an overgrown farm in a small run-down house.  From the beginning, the player is tasked with restoring the farm to its former glory, but how the player accomplishes this is up to them.  They can clear land and plant crops to sell at a profit, build barns and coops to raise animals to sell their eggs and milk for a profit.  They can fish.  They can mine.  They can adventure.  Stardew Valley empowers the player to go at their own pace and do what interests them.  There is no real \"correct\" way to play the game.  There is a simple fun in experiencing milestones, whether that is leveling up a skill to earn a perk, upgrading a tool for increased inefficiency, or watching as the villagers become more friendly with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Players can become friends with townsfolk, learn their backgrounds (Some of which are incredibly well-written emotional stories), and even date and marry the man/woman they desire.  You can decorate your home.  You can become a mainstay in the village by repairing the community center, and many other nuanced things.  I found myself becoming invested in the little village and its characters and particularly enjoyed the routines of the villagers to be an interesting addition. (\"Oh, oops, of course the store is closed on Tuesdays, she's over at the Fitness Group!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "The graphics are clean, and the music/sound effects are enjoyable to listen to.  All of this is even more impressive when you consider that the entire game was made by a single individual.  Stardew Valley is a fantastic game for folks who are looking for a different type of game - especially those who enjoy experiencing growth and progress.  There's a great satisfaction from delivering a good harvest and spending your money.  I really recommend this game - it was an absolute joy to play and holds a great charm.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Charming, but lacks the ability to keep me playing in the long term. Granted, I've put in about 60 hours at this point, which is more than a lot of games but I don't feel like there is anything left for me to get out of it. I think the true power of this game is its \"grindy\" addictive nature. It's like farmville on steroids without **** micro-transactions. It's not really a new or groundbreaking thing, but harvesting, mining, and fishing in this game somehow scratch this indescribable itch I never knew I had. A good game to be sure, and well worth the money, but I don't know if I will ever go back to it.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stardew Valley is the kind of game that you watch someone play and think to yourself, or if you're feeling rude you say to the person, \"How could you possibly waste your time on that!?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then after much prodding and pushing you decide to give it a try...and...well...then you're preaching about the wonders of this game that only just a little bit ago you were criticising. Welcome to Stardew Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing about this game is that it's really fun. It has all the elements of Harvest Moon you may or may not have loved and then takes everything just a step further in terms of depth, farming...there's some RPG elements present that are light but very enjoyable. Also, runs perfectly on low spec machines. It's a prefect laptop game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, nothing I say is going to convince you to buy it a try it. Just do it. It's a lot of fun...even if on the surface you can't imagine how that's possible.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A game that finally brings Harvest moon type of gameplay to the PC community. With the graphics and the presentation the game brings back nostalgia but in a great way. This game sucked over 150 hours in the month of January alone. With the game having an immersive feeling and the characters around town you can get joy when you fix up the town hall and marry that cute awkward girl you may have had an eye on if you know who I mean. Its definitely worth the price tag even if its a game you play once a month or once a week to relieve stress. Trust me when I say this game as a college student has made me forget the dread of finals week more than once\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is the most adorable game I've ever played. You can create your own little character and tend to your farm, make friends, fight off monsters, complete tasks, and pretty much do whatever you like. I have put over a hundred hours into this game and I'm still not at a point that I could consider ' finished'. It is endless. I find the game so soothing, and I never really get bored with it. A really great PC game for people who just want to relax.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I thought this game was so fun! I thought was very unique and not like other games. The graphics and story of the game are very aesthetic, and it lasts for thousands of in-game years. Although, I wish you could earn more than 8 stars with everyone (besides being married to them), and I wish there was more info of the game because I usually have to look up how to do something or how to get certain fish or crops. Overall, the game is so much fun and very addicting!\n",

Ici, le grand-père nous laisse sa ferme et son (immense) terrain en piteux état, ainsi il faut rénover, cultiver et gagner de l’argent pour développer le tout. Si le gameplay est agréable, j’ai quand même l’impression d’avoir fait le tour des choses à découvrir/faire après un peu plus de dix heures de jeu, surtout après avoir atteint le niveau le plus profond de la mine. Je regrette notamment que le plus gros des quêtes consiste a récupérer des objets perdus (je me demande encore pourquoi le short du maire était chez ma voisine !), ou encore de donner des œufs, ou autres… ça finit par perdre de l’intérêt. Stardew Valley est une belle petite aventure à vivre mais manque en mon sens de quelques éléments supplémentaires pour m’attirer plus qu’il ne l’a fait.\n",

      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "I prefer Animal Crossing much more.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Having never played Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, this primarily reminded me of Chocobo's Dungeon 2, with a greatly expanded out-of-dungeon playset - which is fantastic. This game's sucked me in for three days straight, which hasn't happened to me in years. Things are subtle and deep - not overplayed and always obvious (stay away from the Wikia except maybe to look up where fish are, btw!). It does require a pretty insane amount of time (luckily[?!], I just burned off most of my right hand so am out of work for a couple weeks) - so this might not be for someone who doesn't have time for anything but bite-sized chunks (you can't save at will, unfortunately, unless you go to sleep early).\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm having trouble praising it because I instinctively want to balance it but don't have many bad things to say about it. The run speed is dreadfully slow, but there are plenty of ways around it (I went with \"Stardew Injector\" and set runspeed to 2). There're also two games here -- there's stuff that doesn't work (grinding; watching the TV every morning for recipes, chopping TONS of wood, gifting [this should probably be redone from scratch...], farming), and stuff that carries the game to a 8-10 rating (surprise unlocks and lots of RNG tables, cool stuff to craft to make your already-cool unlocks become even better items, way more content than I think anyone would anticipate even after playing a full 10+ hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "I struggle to make cheese in real life - and love the stuff, so when I first got to milk a cow and saw cheese in the community center bundle, I knew all my milk was going in the fridge until I unlocked something to transform to cheese, and I really can't explain why it was so thrilling to finally make my first batch, but it was, so great on ConcernedApe for getting me giddy as a schoolgirl about making virtual cheese. -And now I save my cheese because I know one day, I'll unlock some awesome recipe and I'll be using cheese power to blast through the crystal mines down to level 50+ without breaking a sweat. It's such an enjoyable time investment that even as someone who looks down on losers who invest boatloads of time for a string of data in a program, I get sucked right in to the same thing, and I don't even feel dirty about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "-So congratulations on discovering this game. Go out and buy it, now!\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Last year I played Story of Seasons (Harvest Moon without the title) for 8 hours and felt like I was no longer able to derive enjoyment out of these games. BUT BAM! Stardew Valley came out and though trepidatious I was I took the plunge and boy do I have no regrets. It's difficult to point out just what Stardew Valley does that is so much better but I would gander that it has something to do with the interminable list of upgrades, collections, and quests that keep you playing. I am nearly 30 hours in and I want to get married, get the bus to start working so I can mine in the desert, get a bigger barn, get a bigger coop, upgrade my house so I can have a child, donate my rare finds to the museum so they give me sweet gifts, collect all the rare scarecrows and....so much other stuff. Why do I want to do this? Idk. I don't want to to do any of this stuff in real life. It's bizarre but I love this game.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Stardew Valley was presented to me as \"a farming game\". What an understatement that does not do it justice. It offers roleplaying elements, exploration, progression, crafting and building - all in a good 16 bit look.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the game seems to ask the player for basic chores - and the days seem to be too long for the few things to do - but very soon there is such a huge list of things you want to do that the days seem way too short ... and the actual farming seems to take away too much from what might be considered \"spare time activities or hobbies\".\n",
      "Balance of time management, rewards and progression seem fine to me. There is a lot of freedom to act and choose. Do you want to perfect profit? Do you want to socialize with the townsfolk? Do you by chance become a dungeon crawling adventurer? - or a lot of other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stardew Valley is one of those games that i believed to be rubbish when i heard of it first.... a pixel farming game (yea - like that is fun... ) - but it turned out to be not only fun, but utterly amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now - at that point i cannot make a judgement about its long term/end game state. I reckon that - once the player has established a near perfect income basis and befriended most of the town or found out most locations backstory and lore - there won t be too much to do anymore. But up to that point - there is plenty of fun to be had ... especially for the price.\n",

      "Si quieres una experiencia distinta, mucho más tranquila y viciarte unas horas, este es uno de los juegos que mejor cumple esos requisitos.\n",

      "If you ever feel like managing a farm, there simply is no better game on the market. But then you get more. You get characters to interact with, relationships to build, many other tasks besides farming that you can, like fishing, mining, fighting monsters...and then the soundtrack...the soundtrack will make you lose your mind. It's simply too good. Too addictive. You know you want to play it. And more. Just a little more.\n",

Stardew Valley is a finished game with a lot of content missing.\n",

      "Seriously, before I even buy this game, I thought it will be a crappy copycat of Harvest Moon/牧場物語. This game turns out to be a superb piece and you can really feel how much passion the developer put into it. A lot of room for improvement but that does not hide this gem.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Perfect game, only wish the controller support was actually designed properly, often you find yourself swinging at the air and watering the wrong crops, but hey, once your farm is automated it doesn't hold you back from everything else.

      "You can tell this game was crafted with passion. The core gameplay is similar to cookie clicker - grow A to sell for $100 so you can buy seeds for B to grow and sell for $500 and so on, but what really impressed me was how well the game conveys the feeling of living in Pleasantville USA. The townspeople are friendly with a bunch of different personalities and secret problems.\n",

Right away the general ambiance and feel of the game grabbed me, the layout of the area, in game sounds and music, character progression and the way time and seasons are handled are all done well. There are no linear game play limits you find in so many other games, you are free at the outset to explore, farm, fish, gather, attend events or not.\n",
